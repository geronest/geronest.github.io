
I enjoy many different kinds of games, ranging from digital games to boardgames.

# Boardgame Design

One of my important identities is boardgame designer.
I have not made any money (yet) from designing games, nor am I diligently working on designs, but I am still serious about it!
I am into designing games with (only) playing cards these days, as they are easy to get anywhere and physically compact.
Have a look at my [Boardgamegeek designer profile](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/158301/seongho-son), where I have already uploaded two of my games: [`leap of faith`](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/409357/leap-of-faith) and [`shareholders`](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/408602/shareholders).
